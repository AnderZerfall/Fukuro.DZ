Hello there, FUKURO is on the line!
Here is my personal project - FUKURO portfolio website!

Let's dive into more details.

## Project's Goal & Requirements

The main goal of this project was to create a place to present my work to potential clients with an opportunity to express myself as much as possible.
That was the time when I had only started learning JS, so I tried my best to understand how event loop works by implementing as much event handlers as possible. Also, I was experimenting with css effects at that time, so you're going to see a tone of effects.


**Project's Requirements**
- *Creating nice and unique landing page where I could display all necessary info about myself: my bio, projects, skills, contact from*
- *Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and mobile-first design principles*
- *Keep user engaged*
- *Implementing various event handlers for practicing in event loop understanding*
